half way through an auto rebirth. have it identifying the hero who loads
in so we can select the equipment and skill sets to loadout. needs a good code clean and 
optimising / testing before i add the auto skills into the mix.

Todo
auto nitro
auto .4 .8 repeated dungeon crawl toggles
auto skill sets

auto net makeing + capture
^auto check alchemy level and raise if needed for tincture or Nets 
expand auto slime bank so if primary option in config is too expensive default to secondary+

refine equipment sets so can have unlimited setnames
refine skill sets once implemented to do the same
